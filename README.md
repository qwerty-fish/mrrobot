###Church of the Savior on Blood
The first 2 images depict the Church of the Savior on Blood in St. Petersburg Russia. The first image is of course our guy Mr. Robot doing the jesus pose, while the second is a picture of the shrine. The Church of the Savior on Blood was built by Alexander III to, and here is a bit of foreshadowing, commemorate his father Alexander II. His father was sabotaged by a grenade thrown by an **anarchist** conspirator. Also, the first grenade didn't kill the Tsar, who was quite pissed and began rebuking the crowd, only to have a second conspirator throw another bomb, killing himself and mortally wounding the tsar.

Also, just for good measure, Alexander II was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator. Unfortunately, his son was a bit of a dickhead and while he was styled "The Peacemaker", he was pretty conservative.Alexander became estranged from his father. Also, Alexander III disagreed with the political views of Alexander II, and was upset that he publicly took a mistress while his wife was dying of illness.

##Back to the Future?
For some reason Elliot just likes sequels and shit so he skips straight ahead to Back to the Future. They arrive on **October 21, 2015,** where Doc electronically knocks out Jennifer and leaves her asleep in an alley, explaining that she should not have too much knowledge of future events. He has Marty pose as his own son to refuse an offer to participate in a robbery with Biff's grandson, Griff. I didn't see the movie so I am not going to expand on this a ton. However, the first picture shows a calendar in the background with pumpkins on it. They left from October 1985 which would fit the time horizon of that picture given Elliot is ~28. His dad "died" when he was 8, and Andrea remarks at ballet that he had a rough 20 years.

The rest of the movie is a jumbled mess of plotlines where the timeline is disjointed and difficult to follow. There are numerous copies of charachters in the same time period and shit is just confusing as hell. So that is a pretty fucking good parrallel to draw, eh?

Oh one last bit, the movie ends suddenly as courier from Western Union arrives and hands Marty a 70-year-old letter from Doc stating that he was sent back to 1885 by the lightning strike.

**From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler**
Basil E. Frankweiler is the narrator for the entire book and she begins it informally with a letter to Saxonberg her attorney. She addresses him directly like Elliot begins, and haphazardly fumbles through her introduction before proceeding to narrate the story. Throughout the novel she breaks into the story to addresses him directly. Also, it should be noted he has lost his grandchildren, a fact that Frankweiler acknowledges by asking him if:

>the pictures of your grandchildren the only type you look at?

The grandchildren are only mentioned twice. Anyway, the  book is about 2 kids, **Claudia and Jamie, who run away to New York** after being under appreciated at home. When they arrive in NY they settle into the Museum of Modern Art where a weird happenstance surrounding an angel statue is unfolding. Purported to be done by Michaelangelo, it is soon to be displayed. **In exchange for a full account of their adventure, she will leave the crucial file to them in her will** The story is exclusively **narrated by Mrs. Frankenweiler** and it is revealed her lawyer, to whom she is telling the story, is **Claudia and Jamie's grandfather[the runaway children].**

*Are you sleeping, are you sleeping?

Brother John, Brother John?

Morning bells are ringing, 

morning bells are ringing

Ding ding dong, ding ding dong.*

So that is pretty creepy and shit. Also, it really should be noted that there is no confirmation that she is his sister as he cut her off and left before the conversation was finished. Also, it is definitely not confirmed that Mr. Robot is real, or how the timeline is laid out. 

#Checkov's Gun
This is a principle of storytelling where everything is super deliberately done and has a purpose according to a larger set of ends.

>Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.

So that being said, I just wanted to point out that there is a handgun in the popcorn machine.
